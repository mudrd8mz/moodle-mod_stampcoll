### 3.6.0 ###

* Privacy API implemented. Credit goes to Tony Butler (@tonyjbutler) for the
  contribution.

### 3.5.0 ###

* Was never released.

### 3.4.0 ###

* The `pix_url()` is not used to display the default stamp image any
  more (deprecated in Moodle 3.3).
* Update travis-ci configuration.

### 3.3.1 ###

* Grunt is now used to compile the LESS to CSS.
* The layout fixed and improved for the Boost theme

Tested on Moodle 3.2.

### 3.3 ###

* Added support for Moodle 2.9 - does not use `add_intro_editor()` for this and higher versions.

### 3.2 ###

* Added new button _Toggle stamp display mode_ button that allows to display stamps together
  with their text comments. For accessibility reasons, displaying the text via the `alt` and the
  `title` image attribute was dropped.
* Validation checks for the text maximum length (255 characters) are now performed when giving
  a stamp. In the stamps management screen, attempting to add/update a stamp with too long text
  leads to silently skipping such change. This should be improved in the future.

* New event triggered when user receives a stamp (allows integration with the Level Up! block).

* Added generator for automatic creation of the module instances.
